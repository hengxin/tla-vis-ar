\subsection{The \alloy{} and \alloystar{} Modelling Languages} \label{ss:alloy}

``\alloy{}~\cite{Alloy:2012} provides a domain-specific language for defining relational models: 
models consisting of a set of atoms (or, for our purposes, nodes in a graph), 
and relations (edges in a graph). 
The relational approach makes it a natural fit 
for describing consistency models.
\alloy{} feeds its models into the Kodkod relational model finder,
which in turn uses off-the-shelf SAT~\cite{} solvers to 
search for instances of the given model. 
This flow provides a convenient front end 
suited for asking questions about 
memory models and/or about particular litmus tests. 
The basic \alloy{} syntax is summarized in Table 3." 
However, \alloy{} is based on a first-order relational logic.
The for-all and exists-some quantifiers over relations cannot be described.
To this end, \alloystar{}~\cite{AlloyStar:ICSE2015} is provided to
support higher-order and bounded constraint solver based on the \alloy{} analyzer.
