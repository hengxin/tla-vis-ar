\section{Introduction} \label{section:intro}

Motivations:
Distributed consistency models are quite tricky to understand.
Even worse, in the literature, there are often several variants of a specific consistency model.
For example, Jiang et al. presents six variants of causal consistency in~\cite{SpecFramework:SRDS2020} for non-transactional databases.
Crooks presents a hierarchy of eight variants of snapshot isolation~\cite{Crooks:PODC2017} for transactional databases.
It is difficult, even for experts,
\begin{itemize}
  \item to decide whether a given history satisfies some consistency model or not;
  \item to come up with histories under some constraints (e.g., on size)
    that satisfy or refuse some consistency model; and
  \item to tell the differences between two consistency models
    by presenting distinguishing histories that satisfy one consistency model but refuse the other.
\end{itemize}
All the three tasks are concerned about histories, which are easier for human to understand.

Challenges:
\begin{itemize}
  \item How to formally express consistency models?
\end{itemize}

\bfit{Our Contributions.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Alloy$\ast$ model of both non-transactional and transactional consistency models
  \item Two case studies
\end{itemize}
