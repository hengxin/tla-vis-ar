\bfit{\taskchecking.}
\memsat~\cite{MemSAT:PLDI2010}: ``Given an axiomatic specification of a memory model
and a multi-threaded test program containing assertions,
\memsat{} outputs a trace of the program in which both the assertions
and the memory model axioms are satisfied, if one can be found.
If it cannot find a trace, it outputs a minimal subset of the memory model and program constraints
that are unsatisfiable.''

\bfit{\taskgenerating.}

\bfit{\taskcomparing.}
\cite{Contrasting:CAV2010}: ``systematically comparing hardware memory models
specified using both operational and axiomatic styles.
When the models differs, the tool finds a minimal “litmus test”
program that demonstrates the difference.''
