\section{Related Work} \label{section:related-work}

\bfit{\taskchecking.}
\memsat~\cite{MemSAT:PLDI2010}: ``Given an axiomatic specification of a memory model
and a multi-threaded test program containing assertions,
\memsat{} outputs a trace of the program in which both the assertions
and the memory model axioms are satisfied, if one can be found.
If it cannot find a trace, it outputs a minimal subset of the memory model and program constraints
that are unsatisfiable.''

\cppmem~\cite{CppMem:POPL2011}:``In this paper we establish a mathematically rigorous
semantics for C++ concurrency using Isabelle/HOL.
\cppmem{} tool takes a program in a fragment of C++0x 
and calculates the set of its executions 
allowed by the memory model, displaying them graphically."

\herd~\cite{Herd:TOPLAS2014}:``We present our analysis tool \mole{}, 
which explores a piece of code to 
find the weak memory behaviours that it contains."

\nemos~\cite{Nemos:IPDPS2004}:``Memory models are defined as sets of predicates, 
and litmus tests are contained in a separate test file.
When a memory model is chosen and a test number is selected, 
the FD constraint solver attempts all possible orders 
till it can find an instantiation that satisfies all constraints."

\bfit{\taskgenerating.}
~\cite{Suites:ASPLOS2017}:``This paper presents a methodology 
for synthesizing comprehensive litmus test suites 
directly from a memory model specification."

~\cite{Contrasting:CAV2010}:``Given two specifications,
our approach generates all possible multi-threaded programs up to a specified bound, 
and for each such program, checks if one of the models 
can lead to an observable behavior not possible in the other model."

\bfit{\taskcomparing.}
\cite{Contrasting:CAV2010}: ``systematically comparing hardware memory models
specified using both operational and axiomatic styles.
When the models differs, the tool finds a minimal “litmus test”
program that demonstrates the difference.''

\cite{Comparing:POPL2017}:``We use Alloy to generate litmus tests that 
distinguish three proposed variants of the C11 MCM."

\bfit{Litmus Tests Characteristic Study.}
~\cite{Mistakes:ASPLOS2008}:``Almost all (96\%) of the examined concurrency bugs 
are guaranteed to manifest 
if certain partial order between 2 threads is enforced."

~\cite{Bounds:DAC2011}:``In this paper, we show that for a class of memory models 
that is restricted yet expressive enough
to include all store-atomic hardware memory models, 
litmus tests of a bounded size are sufficient for 
illustrating differences between memory consistency models in this class.
We establish a bound of two threads and 
no more than six memory access instructions 
for differentiating litmus tests
in this class of models."

\bfit{Consistency Testing.}
\violat~\cite{Violat:CAV2019}:``\violat{} generates self-contained test programs which do
not require enumerating linearizations dynamically per execution, instead statically
precomputing the ADT-admitted return-value outcomes per test program."

\monkeydb~\cite{MonkeyDB:OOPSLA2021}:``\monkeydb{} can be configured with one of several isolation levels.
On a read operation, \monkeydb{} computes the set of all possible return values
allowed under the chosen isolation level,
and randomly returns one of them.
The developer can then simply execute their test multiple times
to get coverage of possible weak behaviors."
